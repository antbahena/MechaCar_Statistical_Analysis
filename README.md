## Linear Regression to Predict MPG

#### Which variables/coefficients provided a non-random amount of variance to the mpg values in the dataset?

The variables vehicle_length and ground_clearance provide the non_random amount of variance to the mpg dataset. This is due to their p-values (p <0.05). This means that they variables have a significant impact on the outcome for mpg.

#### Is the slope of the linear model considered to be zero? Why or why not?
No the slope is not considered 0 as the data shows. The coefficients table shows that the independent variables such as vehile_length and vehicle_weight are not zero. 

####Does this linear model predict mpg of MechaCar prototypes effectively? Why or why not?
The linear model does predict effectively to a certain degree this is due to the p-value vehicle_weight variable being at 0.0076 which is greater than 0.05.
